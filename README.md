# VisDiscovery
## B.Sc. Graduation Project


Data analysts often build visualizations as the first step in their analytical workflow. However, when working with high-dimensional datasets, identifying visualizations that show relevant or desired trends in data can be laborious and needs a lot of efforts. Our graduation project introduces VisDiscovery, a visualiza- tion recommendation engine, that recommends interesting visualizations to facilitate fast visual analysis: given a subset of data to be studied, VisDiscovery intelligently explores the space of visualizations, evaluates promising visualizations for trends and recommends those it deems most useful or inter- esting, helping data scientists and analysts connecting things in interesting ways and look at data from different angles.
